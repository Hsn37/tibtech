                        <p>
                            The fusion of computer vision and deep learning has revolutionized non-contact animal monitoring systems, becoming a cornerstone in modern agriculture. 
                            These advanced technologies are pivotal for quantifying animal behavior and detecting diseases early, essential aspects of precision livestock farming that ensure animal health and welfare. 
                            Traditional methods for evaluating farm animal behavior, such as direct observation and physiological measurements, are often disruptive, subjective, and impractical for large-scale application. These methods also lack scientifically validated metrics to accurately assess animal well-being. Current animal welfare standards focus mainly on negative indicators like harm and stress, overlooking the importance of 
                            recognizing and promoting positive states crucial for both animal health and farm productivity.

                        <p>
                            Non-invasive monitoring systems present a promising solution to these challenges. By leveraging stress-minimizing and unbiased technologies, we can gather reliable data on animal welfare, potentially improving both livestock lives and agricultural outputs. Within this domain, pose estimation and instance segmentation are foundational techniques driving efforts to create robust and efficient models for behavioral analysis. While pose estimation offers in-depth insights through extensive datasets across diverse species, instance segmentation provides analytics beyond posture analysis.

                                Sheep, as prey animals, often exhibit flight responses, making running a common behavior that can reveal much about their gaits and speed. By analyzing running videos of individual sheep, we can extract various poses using UMAP embeddings, as illustrated in Figure 3 (A). Each color in the figure represents poses of different animals, showing that while most poses cluster closely, some are more dispersed.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                We validate this observation by clustering the poses into 10 unique groups (Figure 3 (C)). Despite the independence of running patterns among sheep, some share gait patterns, evidenced by overlapping clusters. Figure 3 (D) shows individual sheep’s poses within these clusters. For instance, sheep IDs 025 and 011 have most poses within clusters 9 and 1, respectively. Even sheep with dynamic gait patterns, like ID 014, exhibit most poses in a primary cluster with a few spread across others.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Pose estimation alone offers insights into gait patterns, but speed analysis is crucial for assessing health. Figure 3 (B) displays speed trends at different intervals, showing that sheep with fewer dynamic gait patterns tend to run faster. For example, ID 025, with limited poses, is the fastest, whereas ID 014, with many poses, is slower. This suggests a trade-off between speed and movement variety, aligning with the principles of locomotive efficiency, where consistent movements enhance speed.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                                Understanding gait diversity and speed has practical implications, such as identifying health issues and optimizing herd management, making this research valuable for both academic and agricultural applications.

                                Using advanced animal detection and pose estimation, we analyzed and compared the grazing patterns of sheep in isolated settings versus when they are in a flock. Our findings, illustrated in Figure 3, reveal that sheep exhibit more substantial grazing activity when isolated compared to when they are part of a herd. This increased grazing in solitude is attributed to the absence of social stimuli and potential threats, allowing sheep to focus more intently on feeding.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                In controlled environments devoid of predators or environmental stressors, sheep show reduced vigilance behavior, which is typically heightened in group settings. Our observations support this principle, indicating that solitary sheep take advantage of safety and tranquility to maximize food intake. In contrast, when sheep graze in groups, their feeding is often interrupted by social interactions such as establishing hierarchies or bonding, leading to less overall food consumption.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Quantitative data from our analysis clearly contrasts the two scenarios: isolated sheep show consistent feeding patterns with minimal interruptions, while herd grazing patterns are interspersed with non-feeding activities. This study provides valuable insights into the grazing behaviors of domestic sheep, which can help enhance farm management practices and optimize feeding strategies to improve animal well-being and productivity.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                In summary, our analysis indicates that in controlled scenarios, sheep graze more when alone compared to being in a herd, likely due to fewer distractions and social obligations. However, these findings are based on brief observational periods. A long-term study could reveal different dynamics, as sheep might exhibit varying grazing intensities over extended periods. Our insights are also limited by the dataset scope, which did not capture extended durations or include variables like environmental shifts and detailed social interactions.

                                In Figure 3, the UMAP scatterplots display the resting postures of sheep from both front and side views. Each data point represents an individual instance of a sheep's resting posture. The clustering of points indicates patterns of similarity: tighter clusters suggest more consistent and homogeneous behavior patterns.

                                The left plot, showing the front view, and the right plot, showing the side view, reveal that sheep tend to maintain a consistent resting posture when alone, evidenced by the tightly clustered gray points. This homogeneity is likely due to the absence of external stimuli, leading to uniform resting positions.

                                In contrast, the brown clusters, representing sheep resting in a herd, show a more scattered distribution. This indicates a greater diversity in resting postures, potentially due to social dynamics within the herd or spatial constraints. The scattered clusters suggest that sheep in a herd may change their resting positions more frequently or adopt different postures compared to when they are alone.

                                These UMAP visualizations provide a compelling visual summary of the differences between solitary and social resting states in sheep. This insight is crucial for understanding sheep behavior in controlled environments and has significant implications for animal welfare and livestock management. The findings align with our observations of grazing behaviors, reinforcing the notion that sheep display more uniform behaviors when solitary. Such insights are pivotal for enhancing livestock management and welfare practices in animal husbandry.
