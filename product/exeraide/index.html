                        <p>
                            The journey from <b>initial concept to a viable 
                            therapeutic solution </b>has several challenges in drug development. Traditional computational techniques 
                            struggle to keep pace with the growing demand for speed, accuracy, 
                            and innovation required for drug discovery. In addition, they rely on a single data modality to discover relevant features and miss out the meaningful information present across <b>multimodal datasets</b>. This is particularly critical in understanding complex neurological disorders, 
                            where the urgency to discover effective therapies is heightened by the growing prevalence of conditions like <b>Alzheimer’s, 
                            Parkinson’s, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Mutiple Sclerosis, and Cerebral palsy (CP)</b>, etc., to mention a few. 
                            According to the <a style="color: black;" href="https://csdd.tufts.edu/" target="_blank"> Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development</a>, the 
                            average cost of bringing a new drug to market now exceeds <a style="color: black;" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cost-to-develop-new-pharmaceutical-drug-now-exceeds-2-5b/#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20published%20by,the%20center%20made%20in%202003." target="_blank"><b>$2.6 billion</b></a>, and the process can take over 
                            a decade to complete. Yet, despite these enormous investments, the success rate remains alarmingly 
                            low. A report from the <a style="color: black;" href="https://www.bio.org/ia-reports" target="_blank">Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO)</a> reveals that only <a style="color: black;" href="https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf" target="_blank"><b>1 in 13</b></a> drug 
                            candidates that enter clinical trials will ultimately receive FDA approval. This fragmented approach 
                            slows down drug development, limiting breakthroughs and overburdening wet labs.

                            Global Burden of Disease (GBD)</a> study. In the U.S., Alzheimer’s affects around <b>5 million</b> 
                            people, with numbers projected to triple by 2050. Parkinson’s disease, the fastest-growing 
                            neurological disorder, currently impacts nearly <b>1.3 million</b> Americans, a figure expected to rise to 
                            by 2030. These conditions emphasize the critical need for innovative drug discovery
